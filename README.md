# DSA – Data Structures and Algorithms (C#)

This repository contains C# implementations of basic **Data Structures** concepts required for academic submissions.  
All implementations are done using **arrays, stacks, and queues** with clear and beginner-friendly code.

---

## 📌 Submission I

### 1. QueueStack – Push Friendly
**Description:**  
Implements a **Stack using two Queues** where:
- Push operation is **efficient (O(1))**
- Pop operation is **costly (O(n))**

**File:**  
`QueueStack_PushFriendly.cs`

---

### 2. QueueStack – Pop Friendly
**Description:**  
Implements a **Stack using two Queues** where:
- Push operation is **costly (O(n))**
- Pop operation is **efficient (O(1))**

**File:**  
`QueueStack_PopFriendly.cs`

---

### 3. Unbounded Array Stack
**Description:**  
An **array-based stack** that dynamically:
- Expands when full
- Shrinks when elements are removed  

This ensures efficient memory usage during **push and pop operations**.

**File:**  
`UnboundedArrayStack.cs`

---

### 4. StackQueue – Enqueue Friendly
**Description:**  
Implements a **Queue using two Stacks** where:
- Enqueue operation is **efficient (O(1))**
- Dequeue operation is **costly (O(n))**

**File:**  
`StackQueue_EnqueueFriendly.cs`
