## 📌 Submission I

### 1. QueueStack – Push Friendly
**Description:**  
Implements a **Stack using two Queues** where:
- Push operation is **efficient (O(1))**
- Pop operation is **costly (O(n))**

**File:**  
`QueueStack_PushFriendly.java`

---

### 2. QueueStack – Pop Friendly
**Description:**  
Implements a **Stack using two Queues** where:
- Push operation is **costly (O(n))**
- Pop operation is **efficient (O(1))**

**File:**  
`QueueStack_PopFriendly.java`

---

### 3. Unbounded Array Stack
**Description:**  
An **array-based Stack** that dynamically changes its size:
- Expands when the stack is full
- Shrinks when elements are removed  

This approach ensures **efficient memory usage** during push and pop operations.

**File:**  
`UnboundedArrayStack.java`

---

### 4. StackQueue – Enqueue Friendly
**Description:**  
Implements a **Queue using two Stacks** where:
- Enqueue operation is **efficient (O(1))**
- Dequeue operation is **costly (O(n))**

**File:**  
`StackQueue_EnqueueFriendly.java`
